Hi Everyone :wave:

I want to share a lesson I learned about burnout, from my sister's swimming!

We've all felt the effects of being burned out, overstretched, juggling too many things, pushing too hard - it's hard to always see it coming, and it's never fun when it hits you.

Burnout can happen for a bunch of different reasons.
Workload
Personal things at home
Physical things
Traffic
Young, old,
It happens, and it's part of why we have leave and should take it.

My sister told me a story of how her swim training made the preverbial penny drop on how burnout can look without you even noticing it.

The lesson...
<!-- truncate -->

Swim lesson - at the end 4 laps slow, 4 laps medium, 4 laps full out.
She was swimming along nicely, conserving her energy, feeling good.
Pushing a little bit, felt like she was in her sweet spot, getting a bit tired but managable.
Pushed her hardest, felt like she was giving everything, kicking extra hard and 100% focus.
When she compared her times, her last 4 laps which were full out were slower than her first 4 slow laps
Shocked pikachu.

This is when burnout truely made sense to her - when she could see the full picture evolve within a few minutes.
What happened was she was working at a maintainable pace, she was happy, stressors are normal, you push harder, you give your best and by the end your best is worse than you barely trying.

Have you been at work, working extra hours, pushing a deadline, trying to show up for your team, trying to finish off just this one more thing. Life happens, you can't truely split your work and life from each other, and your work will impact your life just as much as your life will impact your work.

What to look out for from my personal experience.
