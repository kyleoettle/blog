Hi Everyone :wave:

I'm a software engineer who loves reading blogs, I often have a million tabs open from reading a blog and deep diving in to the author's content. It's part of what I love about software engineers and our sharing culture.

I hope you enjoy my blog, I often have a bit of free time on my commute to work and want to use the time to write a few posts, so come along for the ride :train:
